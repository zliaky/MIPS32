WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   uart0/u1/RxD_state[3]_PWR_11_o_Select_45_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.

  Number of Slice LUTs:                         57 out of  63,288    1%
    Number used as logic:                       57 out of  63,288    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              31
      Number using O5 output only:               8
      Number using O5 and O6:                   18
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  15,616    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    23 out of  15,822    1%
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                       16 out of  31,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           59
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            13 out of      59   22%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   2 out of      59    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          44 out of      59   74%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              31 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
